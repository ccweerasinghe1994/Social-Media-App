# Simple-Mern-Setup-2021
    skeliton application for mernstack project



    1.Run the application from the command line: yarn development.

    2. Load in browser: Open the root URL in the browser, which is
    http://localhost:3000 if you are using your local machine. You should   
    see a page with the title MERN Kickstart that just shows Hello World!.

    3. Develop code and debug live: Change the HelloWorld.js component
    text from "Hello World!" to just "hello". Save the changes to see the
    instantaneous update in the browser, and also check the command-line
    output to see that bundle.js is not re-created. Similarly, you can also see
    instant updates when you change the server-side code, increasing
    productivity during development.
